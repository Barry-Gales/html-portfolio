        <p>Below you will find a preview of a couple projects when I was
            taking a web development course using Udemy.com while waiting
            to see if I'll get accepted into Launch Code which is a free
            program that actually teach web development then at the end 
            has an apprenticeship program that if accepted will act as a
            liason between you and major companies I.E. Boeing, Mastercard etc.</p><hr>
