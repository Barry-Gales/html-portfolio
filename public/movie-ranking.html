<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This movie is the best movie of all time in my opinion.
 The combination of a love story that will encapsulate you and make you believe
 that this is love in the world.</p><br><hr>
 <h3>Legion</h3>
 <p>This movie is awesome and makes you think about the end of the world.</p><br><hr>
 <h3>A Quiet Place</h3>
 <p>This movie plays with your senses and makes you be on edge all of the time 
 because the people need to be quiet otherwise they will get killed.
